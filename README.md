1. Write a C++ program which performs five basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %). Your
program should prompt the user to enter two integers and once character, where the character
variable will indicate the specific arithmetic operation to be performed. Your program should
have the following interface. In the following example, 5 and 7 are the two integers and + is
the character value entered by the user. Based on the value of this character variable, your
program should perform the appropriate arithmetic operation. You have to write this program
using both ‘if/else’ and ‘switch’ statements, one by one.
Output of your program must be presentable.

2. Consider a file “input.txt” having four real values. Display the largest and smallest value.
3. Develop a program that will determine the gross pay for each of several employees. The

company pays “straight time” for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and pays “time-
and-a-half” for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. Take input from user for three

employees of the company, the number of hours each employee worked last week and the
hourly rate of each employee. Your program should input this information for each employee
and should determine and display the employee's gross pay. Here is a sample input/output
dialog:

4. Company ‘CarsNLoans’ offers car loans to its customers. Every year, the company spends
thousands of rupees for printing the tariff brochures. It is now planning to cut down on this
expenditure by making a small computer application available to its customers using which
the customers can calculate the monthly installment rates. You have been asked to write a
C++ code for this application. Your program should prompt the user to enter values of the
following parameters.
• Vehicle Price (Total cost of car)
• Down Payment (First payment made while purchasing the car)
• Installment Months (Number of months for which loan is required)
Here is the method to calculate “Monthly Installments”.
Enter the arithmetic expression to be evaluated:
5
+
7
5 + 7 = 12

• Payable Amount = Vehicle Price – Down Payment
• New Payable Amount = (Payable Amount + (Payable Amount * Interest Rate))
• Monthly Installment = New Payable Amount / Installment Months
Interest Rate is applicable as below;

Installment Months Interest Rate
Less than or equal to 12 10% of Payable amount
Greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 15% of Payable amount
Greater than 24 and less than or equal to 36 20% of Payable amount
Greater than 36 and less than or equal to 48 25% of Payable amount
Greater than 48 and less than or equal to 60 30% of Payable amount
Your program should have the following interface.

Enter the Vehicle Price in rupees : 800000
Enter the Down Payment in rupees : 300000
For how many months, do you want to lease the car : 36
Your Monthly Installment is : Rs.16666.7

2. Consider a file “timeInput.txt” having a value showing the total number seconds, that an
algorithm takes to find a solution. Take it as an input to your program and display the number
of hours, minutes, and seconds. Also, store the result in the file named “timeOutput.txt”.
Note: The input file is present in the same directory.
